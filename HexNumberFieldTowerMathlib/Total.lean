Total forms of the tower operations.

Each `Option`-valued tower operation has a completeness theorem showing it
never returns `none`. These definitions unwrap the option with that proof, so
users who import the companion can write `adjoin` instead of
`(adjoin? ..).get!`. Each is `Option.get` applied to the operation it names
and adds no computation of its own; the `Option`-valued operations remain the
conformance and performance owners.
